# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the application from a GGUF-only loader into a universal AI model loader that supports all major model formats including GGUF, safetensors, PyTorch bin files, and direct Hugging Face model loading. The system will leverage existing backend infrastructure (transformers, ctransformers, llama-cpp-python, llamafile) while adding format detection, automatic backend selection, and seamless model loading across different formats. This addresses critical issues with model loading, particularly for newer models like DeepSeek, while expanding the application's capabilities to handle the entire ecosystem of available AI models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load any AI model format (GGUF, safetensors, PyTorch bin, or Hugging Face models) seamlessly through a unified interface, so that I can use any model from the AI ecosystem without worrying about technical format differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a model file or directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the format and select the appropriate backend
2. WHEN a user provides a Hugging Face model ID THEN the system SHALL download and load the model using the transformers backend
3. WHEN model validation encounters format issues THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative loading methods and backends
4. WHEN a model fails initial validation THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and suggest solutions
5. WHEN loading DeepSeek or other newer models THEN the system SHALL successfully load them regardless of their distribution format
6. WHEN multiple backends can handle a format THEN the system SHALL choose the most appropriate one based on model characteristics and hardware

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently match models to the best available backend based on format and hardware capabilities, so that I get optimal performance without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GGUF model is loaded THEN the system SHALL prefer llama-cpp-python or llamafile backends
2. WHEN a safetensors or PyTorch model is loaded THEN the system SHALL use the transformers backend
3. WHEN multiple backends support a format THEN the system SHALL choose based on hardware capabilities and model size
4. WHEN a backend fails THEN the system SHALL automatically try compatible alternatives
5. WHEN GPU acceleration is available THEN the system SHALL configure backends to utilize GPU resources
6. WHEN no suitable backend is found THEN the system SHALL provide installation instructions for required dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive error reporting when model loading fails, so that I can understand and resolve the issue quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with the root cause
2. WHEN backend initialization fails THEN the system SHALL suggest specific installation or configuration steps
3. WHEN memory issues occur THEN the system SHALL recommend memory optimization strategies
4. WHEN file format issues are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest model conversion or alternative download sources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle large models gracefully, so that I can load models that approach my system's memory limits without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a large model THEN the system SHALL check available memory before attempting to load
2. WHEN memory is insufficient THEN the system SHALL suggest memory-efficient loading options like quantization or CPU-only mode
3. WHEN loading with limited memory THEN the system SHALL use memory mapping and lazy loading techniques
4. WHEN memory pressure is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust loading parameters to prevent system instability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust model metadata extraction that works with various model formats (GGUF, safetensors, bin), so that the application can display accurate model information regardless of the model's format or origin.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting model metadata THEN the system SHALL handle GGUF metadata, safetensors headers, and PyTorch model configs
2. WHEN metadata extraction fails THEN the system SHALL continue with basic file information and not block model loading
3. WHEN model parameters are unknown THEN the system SHALL estimate them based on file size and structure
4. WHEN model architecture is unrecognized THEN the system SHALL use generic fallback settings that work with most models
5. WHEN loading safetensors models THEN the system SHALL extract tensor information and model architecture from the header
6. WHEN loading PyTorch bin models THEN the system SHALL read config.json files and model metadata from the model directory

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load models directly from Hugging Face Hub by model ID, so that I can easily access thousands of available models without manual downloading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a Hugging Face model ID THEN the system SHALL validate the model exists and is accessible
2. WHEN downloading from Hugging Face THEN the system SHALL show download progress and cache models locally
3. WHEN a Hugging Face model requires authentication THEN the system SHALL prompt for and securely store API tokens
4. WHEN loading Hugging Face models THEN the system SHALL automatically handle tokenizers, configs, and model files
5. WHEN Hugging Face models are updated THEN the system SHALL detect and offer to download newer versions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle all model formats through existing backends, so that I can use my current setup without installing additional software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading safetensors models THEN the system SHALL use the enhanced transformers backend with safetensors support
2. WHEN loading PyTorch bin models THEN the system SHALL use the transformers backend for loading and inference
3. WHEN loading GGUF models THEN the system SHALL continue using existing llama-cpp-python and llamafile backends
4. WHEN backend capabilities are insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide clear upgrade instructions
5. WHEN multiple model files exist in a directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and load the complete model
