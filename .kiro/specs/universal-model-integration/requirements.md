# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the chat, summarization, and email automation tabs with the new universal model loading system. The universal model loading system provides enhanced capabilities including multi-format support (GGUF, safetensors, PyTorch, Hugging Face), intelligent backend routing, enhanced error reporting, and improved memory management. The tabs need to be updated to leverage these new capabilities while maintaining their existing functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat tab to automatically work with any model format supported by the universal loading system, so that I can have conversations regardless of the model format I choose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is loaded through the universal loading system THEN the chat tab SHALL receive enhanced model information including format type, backend used, and capabilities
2. WHEN the universal loading system reports loading progress THEN the chat tab SHALL display appropriate progress indicators with stage information
3. WHEN a model loading fails through the universal loading system THEN the chat tab SHALL display enhanced error information with suggested solutions
4. WHEN multiple model formats are available THEN the chat tab SHALL work seamlessly with GGUF, safetensors, PyTorch, and Hugging Face models
5. WHEN backend fallback occurs THEN the chat tab SHALL inform the user about the backend change and any performance implications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the summarization tab to leverage the universal model loading system's capabilities, so that I can summarize documents using the most appropriate model and backend for the task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is loaded for summarization THEN the summarization tab SHALL receive model metadata including optimal parameters for summarization tasks
2. WHEN the universal loading system detects memory constraints THEN the summarization tab SHALL adjust its processing approach accordingly
3. WHEN enhanced error reporting is available THEN the summarization tab SHALL provide detailed feedback about summarization failures
4. WHEN different model formats are loaded THEN the summarization tab SHALL adapt its interface to show format-specific capabilities
5. WHEN backend routing selects an optimal backend THEN the summarization tab SHALL display backend information and expected performance characteristics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the email automation tab to have improved UI and integrate AI reply generation with the universal model loading system, so that I can have a better email experience with AI-powered replies using any supported model format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing email previews THEN the email list SHALL show only email title and sender information, not the email body
2. WHEN the window is resized THEN email list items SHALL maintain proper spacing and not overlap each other
3. WHEN a model is loaded THEN the email automation tab SHALL enable AI reply generation features while keeping existing email synchronization unchanged
4. WHEN generating AI replies THEN the system SHALL use the universal model loading system for optimal performance
5. WHEN model loading fails THEN the email automation tab SHALL disable only AI reply features while keeping email synchronization functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent model status information across all tabs, so that I always know which model is loaded and its current state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the universal loading system updates model status THEN all tabs SHALL receive synchronized status updates
2. WHEN loading progress changes THEN all tabs SHALL display consistent progress information
3. WHEN model capabilities are detected THEN all tabs SHALL show relevant capability information for their specific use case
4. WHEN errors occur THEN all tabs SHALL display consistent error information with tab-specific guidance
5. WHEN model metadata is available THEN all tabs SHALL have access to relevant metadata for their functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tab integration to be maintainable and extensible, so that future enhancements to the universal loading system automatically benefit all tabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new model formats are added to the universal loading system THEN existing tabs SHALL automatically support them without code changes
2. WHEN new backend types are added THEN tabs SHALL automatically work with them through the routing system
3. WHEN enhanced error reporting is improved THEN tabs SHALL automatically benefit from better error messages
4. WHEN performance optimizations are added THEN tabs SHALL automatically use improved performance characteristics
5. WHEN monitoring capabilities are enhanced THEN tabs SHALL automatically report better usage metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated resource monitoring header in the main window that shows real-time system usage, so that I can monitor the impact of the loaded model on my system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is loaded THEN a resource monitoring header SHALL appear below the model loading section with the same width
2. WHEN the resource monitoring header is displayed THEN it SHALL show the current backend name being used
3. WHEN the system is running THEN the header SHALL display live RAM usage updated every 2 seconds
4. WHEN the system is running THEN the header SHALL display live CPU usage updated every 2 seconds
5. WHEN GPU is available THEN the header SHALL include a button that shows GPU usage details when clicked
6. WHEN no model is loaded THEN the resource monitoring header SHALL be hidden or show inactive state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tabs to provide feedback about model performance and resource usage, so that I can make informed decisions about model selection and usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is actively being used THEN tabs SHALL display relevant performance metrics for their specific use case
2. WHEN memory usage is high THEN tabs SHALL warn users and suggest optimizations
3. WHEN backend performance varies THEN tabs SHALL provide feedback about response times and quality
4. WHEN model switching would be beneficial THEN tabs SHALL suggest alternative models or configurations
5. WHEN resource constraints are detected THEN tabs SHALL provide guidance on optimizing usage
