# Theme Consistency Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need for proper theme consistency across the GGUF Loader application, specifically ensuring that all UI elements (textboxes, input fields, buttons, backgrounds) properly adapt to light and dark modes. Currently, some elements maintain light backgrounds in dark mode or vice versa, creating visual inconsistencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want all input fields and textboxes to have appropriate background colors that match the current theme, so that the interface looks consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is in light mode THEN all textboxes SHALL have white or light gray backgrounds
2. WHEN the application is in light mode THEN all input fields SHALL have white or light gray backgrounds  
3. WHEN the application is in light mode THEN text content SHALL be dark colored for readability
4. WHEN the application is in dark mode THEN all textboxes SHALL have dark backgrounds (#1e1e1e, #2d2d30, or similar)
5. WHEN the application is in dark mode THEN all input fields SHALL have dark backgrounds (#1e1e1e, #2d2d30, or similar)
6. WHEN the application is in dark mode THEN text content SHALL be light colored for readability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all dialog boxes and settings windows to have consistent theming, so that no UI element looks out of place regardless of the theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the Email Settings Dialog in light mode THEN all backgrounds SHALL be white or light colored
2. WHEN opening the Email Settings Dialog in dark mode THEN all backgrounds SHALL be dark colored
3. WHEN opening any dialog in light mode THEN group boxes SHALL have light backgrounds with dark borders
4. WHEN opening any dialog in dark mode THEN group boxes SHALL have dark backgrounds with light borders
5. WHEN switching between themes THEN all dialogs SHALL immediately reflect the new theme

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want buttons and interactive elements to have proper hover and focus states that work with both themes, so that I can easily identify interactive elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over buttons in light mode THEN they SHALL show appropriate light theme hover effects
2. WHEN hovering over buttons in dark mode THEN they SHALL show appropriate dark theme hover effects
3. WHEN focusing on input fields in light mode THEN they SHALL show light theme focus indicators
4. WHEN focusing on input fields in dark mode THEN they SHALL show dark theme focus indicators
5. WHEN an input field has focus THEN the border color SHALL be theme-appropriate (blue in both modes)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme detection to work automatically based on the parent window's theme, so that dialogs always match the main application theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main application is in dark mode THEN all child dialogs SHALL automatically detect and apply dark mode
2. WHEN the main application is in light mode THEN all child dialogs SHALL automatically detect and apply light mode
3. WHEN theme detection fails THEN the system SHALL default to light mode
4. WHEN the parent window background is detected as dark (#1e1e1e, #2d2d30, #000000) THEN dark mode SHALL be applied
5. WHEN the parent window background is any other color THEN light mode SHALL be applied

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized theming system that can be easily applied to any dialog or UI component, so that theme consistency is maintainable across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new dialogs THEN they SHALL use the centralized theme system
2. WHEN updating existing dialogs THEN they SHALL be migrated to use the centralized theme system
3. WHEN the theme system is applied THEN it SHALL handle all common UI elements (inputs, buttons, labels, group boxes)
4. WHEN the theme system detects the current mode THEN it SHALL return appropriate CSS styles for all elements
5. WHEN applying themes THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable with proper contrast ratios
