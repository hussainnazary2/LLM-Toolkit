# Model Backend Synchronization Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical issue where the UI shows a model as loaded but the backend manager doesn't have an active model, resulting in no responses when users ask questions. The system needs to ensure proper synchronization between the UI state and the actual backend model loading state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Model State Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to validate that a model is actually loaded in the backend before showing it as available in the UI, so that I don't get confused by misleading status indicators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI displays a model as loaded THEN the backend manager SHALL have a current_backend with an active model
2. WHEN a model loading operation completes THEN the system SHALL verify the backend manager has the model properly loaded before updating the UI
3. IF the backend manager doesn't have a loaded model THEN the UI SHALL display "No model loaded" status
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL check for any existing loaded models and synchronize the UI state accordingly

### Requirement 2: Model Loading Process Integrity

**User Story:** As a user, I want the model loading process to properly connect the loaded model to the backend manager, so that I can actually use the model for text generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Load Model" and select a GGUF file THEN the system SHALL load the model into the backend manager's current_backend
2. WHEN model loading completes successfully THEN the backend manager SHALL have a non-null current_backend with the loaded model
3. WHEN model loading fails THEN the UI SHALL display the actual error message and reset to "No model loaded" state
4. WHEN a model is loaded THEN the system SHALL verify text generation capability before marking the model as ready

### Requirement 3: Text Generation Response Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive responses when I ask questions to a loaded model, so that I can actually interact with the AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message to the chat THEN the system SHALL verify a model is loaded in the backend manager before attempting generation
2. WHEN a model is properly loaded THEN text generation requests SHALL return actual responses, not empty results
3. WHEN text generation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the issue
4. WHEN the backend manager has no current_backend THEN the system SHALL display "Please load a model first" message

### Requirement 4: Backend Manager State Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of the backend manager state, so that I can diagnose model loading and generation issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model loading operations occur THEN the system SHALL log the backend manager state before and after loading
2. WHEN text generation is requested THEN the system SHALL log whether the backend manager has a current_backend
3. WHEN backend state changes THEN the system SHALL emit events that the UI can respond to
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the backend manager state

### Requirement 5: UI State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to accurately reflect the actual model loading state, so that I know when the system is ready for use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend manager has no current_backend THEN the model dropdown SHALL show "No model loaded"
2. WHEN a model is successfully loaded in the backend THEN the UI SHALL update to show the model name and enable chat functionality
3. WHEN model loading is in progress THEN the UI SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN the backend manager state changes THEN the UI SHALL automatically update to reflect the new state
