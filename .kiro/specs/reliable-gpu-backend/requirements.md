# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current GGUF loader app relies on llama-cpp-python for model loading and inference, but this library has proven problematic for GPU acceleration setup on Windows systems. Users experience installation failures, CUDA toolkit conflicts, and unreliable GPU detection. This feature will migrate the app to use a more reliable GPU-accelerated backend that provides easier installation, better GPU support, and maintains compatibility with GGUF models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with an NVIDIA GPU, I want the app to automatically detect and use my GPU for model inference without complex installation procedures, so that I can get faster performance without technical hassles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL automatically detect available NVIDIA GPUs
2. WHEN a compatible GPU is found THEN the app SHALL use GPU acceleration by default
3. WHEN GPU acceleration is active THEN inference speed SHALL be significantly faster than CPU-only mode
4. WHEN GPU memory is insufficient THEN the app SHALL gracefully fall back to CPU mode with a clear message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the GPU backend installation to be simple and reliable, so that I don't have to deal with build failures or CUDA toolkit configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing GPU support THEN the installation SHALL complete successfully without requiring manual CUDA toolkit setup
2. WHEN the installation fails THEN the app SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
3. WHEN using prebuilt wheels THEN they SHALL be available and downloadable without network timeouts
4. WHEN the backend is installed THEN it SHALL work immediately without additional configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to maintain compatibility with my existing GGUF models, so that I don't have to re-download or convert my model files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading existing GGUF models THEN they SHALL work with the new backend without modification
2. WHEN switching backends THEN model loading performance SHALL be maintained or improved
3. WHEN using different quantization formats THEN they SHALL be supported (Q4_0, Q4_1, Q8_0, etc.)
4. WHEN loading large models THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized for the available hardware

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to monitor GPU usage and performance, so that I can verify GPU acceleration is working and optimize my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPU acceleration is active THEN the app SHALL display GPU utilization metrics
2. WHEN running inference THEN GPU memory usage SHALL be visible in the interface
3. WHEN performance issues occur THEN diagnostic information SHALL be available
4. WHEN switching between CPU and GPU modes THEN the change SHALL be reflected in the UI immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with AMD or Intel GPUs, I want the app to support my hardware for acceleration, so that I'm not limited to NVIDIA-only solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AMD GPU with ROCm support is detected THEN it SHALL be used for acceleration
2. WHEN an Intel GPU with appropriate drivers is detected THEN it SHALL be used for acceleration
3. WHEN multiple GPUs are available THEN the app SHALL allow selection of the preferred device
4. WHEN unsupported GPU hardware is detected THEN the app SHALL provide clear information about compatibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to be easily replaceable and well-abstracted, so that future backend changes don't require major code rewrites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new backend THEN it SHALL use a common interface that abstracts backend-specific details
2. WHEN adding new backends THEN they SHALL implement the same interface contract
3. WHEN switching backends THEN the UI and core application logic SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN testing different backends THEN they SHALL be easily swappable through configuration
