# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a streaming text output system that delivers clean, readable text to users word by word in real-time without overwhelming the model or creating performance bottlenecks. The system will provide smooth, word-by-word text delivery with proper formatting, spacing, and user-friendly presentation across all text-generating features (chat, summarization, email generation).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see text appear gradually as it's generated, so that I can start reading immediately without waiting for the complete response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model generates text THEN the system SHALL display text word by word as tokens are produced
2. WHEN text is streaming THEN each word SHALL appear smoothly one at a time without jarring jumps
3. WHEN streaming begins THEN the user SHALL see a typing indicator or cursor to show active generation
4. WHEN streaming is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indication that generation has finished
5. WHEN streaming is interrupted THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle partial responses and show completion status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the streamed text to have clean formatting and proper spacing, so that it's easy to read and professional-looking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is streamed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper word spacing without extra spaces
2. WHEN line breaks occur THEN the system SHALL preserve intended paragraph structure
3. WHEN special characters are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly without display artifacts
4. WHEN text formatting is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent font, size, and styling
5. WHEN text wrapping occurs THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth line transitions without text overlap

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the streaming to be smooth and not cause performance issues, so that my system remains responsive during text generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is streaming THEN the system SHALL limit update frequency to prevent UI freezing
2. WHEN large amounts of text are generated THEN the system SHALL buffer appropriately to maintain smooth display
3. WHEN multiple streams are active THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently across all streams
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL adapt streaming rate to maintain responsiveness
5. WHEN streaming is active THEN other UI elements SHALL remain fully functional and responsive

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to control the streaming behavior, so that I can customize the experience to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming is active THEN the user SHALL be able to pause and resume the stream
2. WHEN streaming is paused THEN the user SHALL be able to copy partial text that has already appeared
3. WHEN streaming speed needs adjustment THEN the user SHALL have options to control the display rate
4. WHEN streaming is unwanted THEN the user SHALL be able to disable streaming and see complete responses
5. WHEN streaming preferences are set THEN the system SHALL remember settings across sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want streaming to work consistently across all text-generating features, so that I have a unified experience throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using chat functionality THEN streaming SHALL work with the same behavior as other features
2. WHEN generating summaries THEN streaming SHALL display summary text progressively
3. WHEN generating email replies THEN streaming SHALL show AI-generated content as it's created
4. WHEN switching between features THEN streaming behavior SHALL remain consistent
5. WHEN different model formats are used THEN streaming SHALL work uniformly regardless of backend

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the streaming system to be robust and handle errors gracefully, so that users have a reliable experience even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display partial content and error information
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and resume streaming
3. WHEN model generation stops unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL indicate incomplete response status
4. WHEN streaming buffer overflows THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without losing content
5. WHEN streaming fails to start THEN the system SHALL fall back to non-streaming display mode

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback about the streaming process, so that I understand what's happening and can track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming starts THEN the system SHALL show a clear indicator that text generation is beginning
2. WHEN text is actively streaming THEN the system SHALL display a typing cursor or animation
3. WHEN streaming is buffering THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN streaming encounters delays THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about the wait
5. WHEN streaming completes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that generation is finished and ready for interaction
