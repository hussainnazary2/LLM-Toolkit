# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GGUF loader application has a working GPU-accelerated backend system, but the chat functionality is not configured to use the new GPU accelerating model loading. The chat system still references old model loading methods, causing "No model loaded for text generation" errors even when the new GPU backend has successfully loaded models. This feature will configure the chat system to properly use the new GPU accelerating model loading system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat system to use the new GPU accelerating model loading, so that chat works with GPU-accelerated models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model is loaded using the new GPU backend THEN the chat system SHALL recognize and use it
2. WHEN I send a chat message THEN it SHALL be processed by the GPU-accelerated model
3. WHEN the new GPU backend has a loaded model THEN chat SHALL not report "No model loaded"
4. WHEN GPU acceleration is active THEN the chat SHALL benefit from the improved performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat model service to be configured to use the backend manager, so that it connects to the GPU-accelerated models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat model service initializes THEN it SHALL use the backend manager for model access
2. WHEN checking if a model is loaded THEN it SHALL query the backend manager
3. WHEN generating text THEN it SHALL use the model loaded in the backend manager
4. WHEN the backend manager switches models THEN the chat service SHALL use the new model

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper configuration between the chat service and the GPU backend, so that model loading status is accurately reflected in chat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GPU backend loads a model THEN the chat service SHALL immediately detect it
2. WHEN the GPU backend reports model status THEN the chat service SHALL use this information
3. WHEN model loading completes in the backend THEN the chat interface SHALL enable message sending
4. WHEN the backend unloads a model THEN the chat service SHALL update its status accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the chat system's model references updated to point to the new backend, so that there's no confusion between old and new loading systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat service needs model information THEN it SHALL get it from the backend manager
2. WHEN text generation is requested THEN it SHALL go through the backend abstraction layer
3. WHEN model operations occur THEN they SHALL use the new backend interface exclusively
4. WHEN debugging model issues THEN the logs SHALL show backend manager operations
