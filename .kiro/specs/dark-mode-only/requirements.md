# Dark Mode Only Requirements

## Introduction

This feature transforms the GGUF Loader application into a dark-mode-only application by removing all light mode functionality and theme switching capabilities. The application will permanently operate in dark mode with no option for users to switch to light mode, simplifying the UI and providing a consistent dark experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to always display in dark mode without any theme switching options, so that I have a consistent dark interface experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL always display in dark mode
2. WHEN I look at the View menu THEN there SHALL be no theme switching options
3. WHEN I look at any settings or preferences THEN there SHALL be no light/dark mode toggle
4. WHEN the application runs THEN all UI elements SHALL use dark theme colors consistently
5. WHEN I open any dialog or window THEN it SHALL always appear in dark mode

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all menu items related to theme switching removed from the interface, so that the UI is cleaner and doesn't show options that don't exist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the View menu THEN there SHALL be no "Toggle Dark Mode" or similar options
2. WHEN I open the View menu THEN there SHALL be no "Light Mode" or "Dark Mode" menu items
3. WHEN I right-click on the interface THEN there SHALL be no theme-related context menu options
4. WHEN I access any menu system THEN theme switching options SHALL be completely absent
5. WHEN I look at keyboard shortcuts THEN there SHALL be no shortcuts for theme switching

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all light mode code and theme detection logic removed from the codebase, so that the application is simplified and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN there SHALL be no light mode CSS styles or color definitions
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN there SHALL be no theme detection or switching logic
3. WHEN reviewing the code THEN there SHALL be no conditional theme application code
4. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL not perform any theme detection
5. WHEN dialogs are created THEN they SHALL directly apply dark mode styles without detection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI components to use optimized dark mode styling, so that the interface looks polished and professional in dark mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing input fields THEN they SHALL use optimized dark backgrounds (#1e1e1e or similar)
2. WHEN viewing buttons THEN they SHALL use dark theme colors with proper contrast
3. WHEN viewing text THEN it SHALL be light colored (#ffffff or #f0f0f0) for readability
4. WHEN viewing borders and separators THEN they SHALL use appropriate dark theme colors
5. WHEN viewing any UI element THEN it SHALL follow consistent dark mode design principles

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have no references to light mode in the user interface, so that there's no confusion about available options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading any help text or tooltips THEN there SHALL be no mention of light mode
2. WHEN viewing any error messages THEN there SHALL be no references to theme switching
3. WHEN looking at any user-facing text THEN it SHALL not reference multiple theme options
4. WHEN using the application THEN all terminology SHALL assume dark mode as the only mode
5. WHEN viewing any documentation or help THEN it SHALL reflect the dark-mode-only nature
